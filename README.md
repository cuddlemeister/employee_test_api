This Mock API represents a simple server, where there are authors, posts and comments. Authors can create and comment on their own posts and posts of other authors. 

This API does not require any databases to be attached, all the data has been generated from scratch every time you boot the server. 

__NOTE: ALL YOUR DATA WILL BE REMOVED EACH TIME YOU REBOOT THE SERVER!__

__Also, you should consider that this is a simplified version of the API, no validation of model creation is provided__
